# TLDroid : Basic Tensorflow-Lite usecase and wrapping library for Android

TLDroid is a simple usecase of multiple machine-learning based service, such as image classification, speech sentiment analysis and others by using [Tensorflow-lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite?hl=ko).

It contains various wrapping android library (also for gradle implement by jCenter) for some usage, and prebuilt module that we used in [Mercy-App](https://github.com/mercy-project/mercy_app_v2) to classify real-time object in image and video.

This project was originally developed by the developers of [Mercy-Project](https://github.com/mercy-project), who are actively engaged in machine learning research and development.
